# Polygon-Rotation
Using Java Graphics2D, this program can display any convex 3D polygon.

All of the java class files are included in the repository.  
To run the program, place all of the files in same folder. 
Then run Window through the terminal by typing "java Window".

By clicking the "switch view" button you can switch between seeing 
the surface of the shape and seeing the "wire frame" of the shape.
The bottom control pannel controls an arbitrary rotation. 
Moving the bottom x,y, and z sliders adjusts the vector the shape will be rotated around
and this vector can be seen when in the wire frame view.
The top sliders rotate around the respective axes.
Distance changes the viewing distance, but the entire shape will be drawn whether it
is in the viewing angle or not.
